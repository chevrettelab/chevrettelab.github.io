a|*Ma Andrea Gatmaitan* +
Andrea is a biology major with a minor in pathogenesis. Her first research experience was at the Citrus Research Center where she studied the effects of streptomycin treatments against citrus greening (HLB). She also worked on isolating bacterial endophytes and using them to control citrus canker. After working at the CREC, she joined the entomology department and did research on the mechanism of protein store sensing in fruit flies and how this can modulate their life cycle timing. After her undergraduate studies, she wants to pursue a masters/PhD in molecular biology. Andrea has joined the Chevrette Lab under a prestigious Summer Fellowship from the American Society for Pharmacognosy.
